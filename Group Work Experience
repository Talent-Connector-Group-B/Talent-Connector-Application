                                Project Experience

As all the members of our team are amazing and always ready to work. So the experience of creating our application was tremendously beautiful. 
Gursimran Dhaliwal (100395401)made an executive summary of the project including precise description, services, basic function, project's demand,
its cost and expenses. He also introduced the project so well that other members effortlessly understood its all the aspects. 
Then, Gurleen described the project's mechanism and its requirements. All the group members made use case diagrams and descriptions and from which we 
selected Gursimran Dhaliwalâ€™s use-case as it was most relevant to our project. 
Then Balraj made class  diagram explaining researcher - expert connection. Gursimran Dhaliwal (100395401) made a blue print of our work  which gives us 
an idea about how to arrange it in MS Word document. After that all the group members gave their reviews about class diagrams. Then Balraj created a relational 
database in which all the relations are normalized up to 3NF and Gursimran Sidhu (100413593) sums up all the material of the project and made a bibliography.
Then Gursimran Dhaliwal (100395401) prepared final professional report which covers entire data of the project.
Then Gursimran Sidhu took a keen eye at every aspect of project and we discussed minor mistakes. After correcting them we successfully completed
our "Talent Connectors" project.
The thing which did not went well was time management . We were unable to complete our assigned tasks at scheduled time due to which our pattern of completing tasks 
shuffled. But again, we rearranged our tasks in well manner and put our best effort to complete them before deadline of submission.
